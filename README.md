## Cpmprehensive Sales Insight (2021 - 2022)

## Here are some additional tips for creating a sales dashboard in Power BI:

1. Start by identifying the key metrics you want to track. What are the most important things you want to know about your sales performance?

2. Once you know your key metrics, choose the right visualizations to display them. Consider the type of data you are working with and the message you want to convey.

3. Use filters and slicers to allow users to drill down into your data. This will help them to see the details behind the numbers.

4. Format your dashboard to be visually appealing and easy to read. Use clear and concise labels, and avoid cluttering your dashboard with too many visuals.


## 🚀 Excited to share my latest Power BI dashboard! 🚀

I've been working on creating a dynamic and insightful dashboard that visualizes key business metrics. Here's a quick overview of what it includes:

📊 Pie Chart
📈 Line Chart
📉 Bar Graph
🗺️ Map
📋 Table Chart
💳 Cards
🔄 Slicer


Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI, I was able to calculate essential metrics such as Total Revenue, Overall Cost, Total Quantity, Total Profit, and Count of Orders.

## Key Metrics:

## Total Revenue:

Total_Revenue = SUM('Table'[Sales])
Overall Cost:


Overall_Cost = SUM('Table'[Cost])
Total Quantity:

Total_Quantity = SUM('Table'[Quantity])
Total Profit:

Total_Profit = SUM('Table'[Sales]) - SUM('Table'[Cost])
Count of Orders:

Order_Count = COUNT('Table'[Order_Number])
